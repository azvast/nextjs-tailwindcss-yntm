              You Never Tagged Me™ sheds light upon an issue that is far too
              common within the artistic community. Credit is not given, where
              credit is due. With our first NFT launch featuring the Balmain
              Army, we are addressing just that. Some of the celebrities
              featured in this photo posted on social media in 2016, generating
              millions of likes. While reaching such a grand audience due to the
              enticing elements of the creation, the actual creator Sébastien
              Micke, was never credited (#tagged) for his work on social media.
              As we witness our world rapidly evolving into the era of digital
              art, it’s easier than ever to “tag”, or recognize the artist
              behind the said creation. By building a community where artists
              can now safely share their visions and voices, #YouNeverTaggedMe
              is a movement. A movement that ensures work no longer goes without
              recognition.  Welcome to the movement You Never Tagged Me™. Where
              artists and creators will be delighted by a community… where
              respect, legitimacy & credit is given.  Sébastien Micke, a
              professional photographer originally from the South of France,
              started a 22-year career at the prestigious French magazine Paris
              Match in 1999. Throughout this time, he became a visionary,
              photographing some of the most iconic faces in history for
              additional prestigious magazines such as Vogue, Vanity fair,Elle,
              GQ to name a few… From Paris to New York to now currently based in
              Los Angeles. 2021 approached and Sébastien made the decision to
              focus his creative mind on a new and exciting realm of digital
              art… Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).  With the development of his
              first NFT project, You Never Tagged Me™, Sébastien’s new purpose
              revealed itself. Building a community for the next generation of
              various artists from different cultures and industries, where
              their visions and creations are appreciated by rightfully paying
              recognition where deserved.  Sébastien Micke is at the forefront
              of revolutionizing and legitimizing the NFT industry that his
              passion fueled talent has landed him to date.  The Crypto Brokers™
